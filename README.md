# Winter 2025 Assignment 2

# Process Manager Script

A Python script to list, search, and terminate running processes on a Linux system using command-line arguments.

## How Input is Gathered

Input is collected through *command-line arguments*, parsed using Python’s argparse module.

Supported arguments:
- --list – List all currently running processes.
- --search <process_name> – Search for processes by name.
- --kill <pid> – Terminate a process by its process ID.

## How the Program Works

The script utilizes the subprocess module to interact with the system:

- Runs ps, grep, and kill commands via Python to interact with processes.
- Filters and parses process information from command output.
- Gracefully handles user errors and invalid input.
- Instantly kills the process.

## Output Format

- --list and --search: Display process information (PID, name, user, etc.) directly in the terminal.
- --kill: Prompts for confirmation, then returns success or error messages depending on whether the termination was successful.

## Command-Line Options

| Argument         | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| --list         | Lists all running processes                      |
| --search       | Filters and displays matching processes by name |
| --kill <pid>   | Terminates the specified process ID             |

## Challenges Expected

- Handling permission issues when attempting to kill system processes
- Parsing process information reliably across different Linux distributions
- Preventing unintentional termination of important system processes
- Providing clear and safe prompts and messages to users
- Ensuring robustness and graceful failure for invalid input

## Project Timeline

### Week 1: March 18 - March 24 (Planning & Setup)

##  Example Usage

```bash
# List all running processes
python3 assignment2.py --list

# Search for a process named "chrome"
python3 assignment2.py --search chrome

# Kill a process with PID 12345
python3 assignment2.py --kill 12345
